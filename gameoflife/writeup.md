1. What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

    During the development of this app, several problems arose because we're not that familiar with react hooks. To manage the grid(AKA board), we need to update the cell's color and calculate its neighbors accordingly. Meanwhile, we had to keep track of the cell's occurrences and the number of living cells, they all made things complicated. 

2. Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

    If I had more time, I'll optimize the front-end interface. For example, I'd like to set up more buttons to offer users options to customize the grid as well as heatmap. Also, I want to optimize the application for mobile devices by implementing responsive design. More importantly, to make the game more interesting, I'd like to have a ranking list to keep track of every user's living time.

3. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
    
    First, I assumed the size of cell and grid to provide a reasonable default layout for the game board. Second, regarding user interface design, we rendered some basic buttons, such as reset, run/stop to offer users better experience, they are explicit and help user save time.
